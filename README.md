# Gymtek Student Menu V2

The original program would only work if the topmost directory was located directly on the C: drive. For consistency, I have done the same thing here. For the code to work properly, the old and new programs must be located at these directories (respectively):

``C:\dbase\gymtek``

``C:\STMNU2``
